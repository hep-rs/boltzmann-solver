%% In general, LaTeX commands start with `\` and consist of letters only.
%% Optional parameters are specified in brackets `[]`, whilst compulsory
%% arguments (if any) are specified in braces `{}`.  (Strictly speaking, this is
%% only a convention and packages can use other things.  One notable example is
%% the Beamer package which adds extra optional arguments with `<>'.)
%%
%% LaTeX is generally insensitive to whitespaces including newlines.  So if a
%% functions takes a lot of arguments or has many options, it can be easily
%% split across lines without repercussions.  The one important exception is
%% that full empty lines mark the end/start of a paragraph.

%% All LaTeX documents begin with the the `\documentclass` command which serves
%% to set the general style of the document.  It defines the page layout, the
%% chapter/section styles, how figures appear, etc. and may provide some
%% additional environments too.  LaTeX comes with four main classes: `article`,
%% `report`, `book` and `letter`.
%%
%% The [KOMA-script](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script) package provides
%% alternatives to replacements for the default classes (`scrartcl`, `scrreprt`,
%% `scrbook`, `scrlttr2`) and provides a lot of options to more easily customize the
%% layout of the page.
\documentclass[
  a4paper,             % The size of the layout
  11pt,                % The font size (10pt, 11pt, 12pt)
  oneside,             % Whether the document is one-sided or two-sided
  onecolumn,           % Whether to have one or two columns in the layout
  bibliography=totoc,  % Adjust how the bibliography appears in ToC
  final,               % As opposed to draft (which speeds up compilation)
]{scrartcl}
%% Note all of these optional arguments are required; in fact, most of the ones
%% specified here would have been chosen by default if left unspecified.  There
%% are also some other options which have not be specified but they are
%% documented in the [KOMA-script](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/koma-script)
%% documentation.
%%
%% One of the important options in the list above is `draft`/`final`.  If draft
%% mode is enabled, LaTeX and most packages will disable features which take up
%% a lot of time in order to speed up compilation.  Draft mode also highlights
%% certain error in the output document.  On the other hand, final mode enables
%% all features which will increase (sometimes quite significantly) the
%% compilation time of the document.

%% The part of the document starting from here through to the `\begin{document}`
%% command is called the preamble.  This is where you include additional
%% packages which provide additional functionalities.  Below are many packages
%% which I use on a semi-regular basis.
%%
%% Although you'll find that they are all enabled below, this is for the sake of
%% checking compatibility between all the packages.  It is advisable to only
%% enable those packages you actually need as this will speed up compilation,
%% and decrease the likelihood that two packages conflict.
%%
%% All packages are available from the Comprehence TeX Archive Network (CTAN) at
%% http://ctan.org.  Quite often, for each `\usepackage{pkg-name}`, it is
%% possible to go to http://ctan.org/pkg/pkg-name in order to find information
%% about the package (there are a few exception to this though, in which case a
%% Google search will suffice).
%%
%% Although you'll know the reason for including a package initially, most
%% people will forget this initial reason after a few months.  It is a **VERY**
%% good idea to have a small comment next to *EVERY* `\usepackage` giving a
%% quick recap as to what this package does.  This will be invaluable in case
%% you include two packages which conflict each other.

%% For the vast majority of packages, the order in which they are loaded does
%% not matter.  There are a few exceptions though, mostly relating to the
%% various referencing packages (hyperef, cleveref, ...).  The following package
%% must be loaded first and provides some additional functionalities to other
%% packages.

\usepackage{ifluatex}  % Provides the command \ifluatex

%% Languages
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage[UKenglish]{babel}           % Set up the language
% \usepackage[style=british]{csquotes}    % Advanced handling of quotes.  Must be loaded after minted.
\usepackage[perpage,symbol*]{footmisc}  % Have symbols instead of numbers for footnotes

%% siunitx is an incredible useful package to display numbers and their
%% associated units.  It also offers extra commands to specify lists and ranges
%% of values with units.  Some commands which it provides include:
%% - \SI{quantity}{units}
%% - \SIRange{start}{end}{units}
%% - \SIList{a, b, ..., d}{units}
%% With the units being given as `\kilo\metre\per\year\per\pico\barn`.
\usepackage{siunitx}

%% Adjust the way units are displayed in ranges and units so that they are only
%% mentinoed once.
\sisetup{
  range-units=single,
  list-units=single,
}

%% Declare a few extra units
\DeclareSIUnit\year{yr}
\DeclareSIUnit\barn{b}
\DeclareSIUnit\fb{\femto\barn}
\DeclareSIUnit\pb{\pico\barn}

%% Formatting
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{geometry}   % Customize text width, page height, margins, etc.
\geometry{
  %% See the geometry package's documentation for all the options available
  textwidth=13cm,
}

\usepackage{multicol}   % {multicols}{n} environment
\usepackage{pdflscape}  % {landscape} environment
\usepackage{enumitem}   % Easily customize lists

\usepackage{setspace}   % Line spacing
\singlespacing
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing

%% Change the formatting of titles and sections.
\setkomafont{part}{\normalfont\scshape\Huge}
\setkomafont{partnumber}{\normalfont\scshape\huge}
\setkomafont{section}{\normalfont\Huge}
\setkomafont{subsection}{\normalfont\huge}
\setkomafont{subsubsection}{\normalfont\Large}
\setkomafont{paragraph}{\normalfont\large\scshape}

%% Change the formatting of section entries in the table of contents
\setkomafont{sectionentry}{\scshape}

%% Modify the indentation at the start of each paragraph.
\setlength{\parindent}{1em}

%% Font
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{microtype}   % Fine small typographical details
\usepackage{realscripts} % Use the font's sub- and superscripts

%% LaTeX allows for some if-else statements.  It is very rare that you'll have
%% to use them, though this is one example since we only want to include a
%% particular package if this example is compiled with LuaLaTeX.
\ifluatex
  \usepackage{fontspec}  % Allows for any font to be specified

  % Change the main font
  \setmainfont{EBGaramond12}[

\else

  \usepackage{ebgaramond}
\fi %% marks the end of the if-else statement

%% Graphics & Figure
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Graphics can be included in a LaTeX document with
%%
%% ```
%% \includegraphics[options]{image}
%% ```
%%
%% Usually, the extension for the image is not specified and LaTeX will
%% figure out the best one.  It is of course possible to add the extension to
%% specify a particular image.
%%
%% In order to ensure that the image is a particular width, you can use
%% `width=<distance>`.  This will also scale the height but keep the aspect
%% ratio (if you also specify the height, the aspect ratio will not be kept).
%% It is tempting to specify an exact distance such as `4cm`; but it is
%% generally better to have a relative distance such as `0.4\linewidth`.  This
%% way, the image will scale nicely if the context is changed.
\usepackage{graphicx}   % Handle graphics

%% Look for images in the './images/' sub-directory
\graphicspath{{./images/}}

\usepackage{xcolor}     % Define and use colours
\usepackage{subcaption} % Subfigures inside a figure

\usepackage{tikz}       % Powerful drawing language
\usepackage{pgfplots}   % Plotting with LaTeX
\usepackage[compat=1.1.0]{tikz-feynman}  % Package to draw Feynman diagram
\pgfplotsset{compat=1.14}

%% TikZ pictures and plots can significantly increase the time it takes to
%% produce the output.  The `external` TikZ library library defers the creation
%% of these figures to a sub-process which creates a separate PDF file which is
%% then simply imported into the main document.  To call the sub-process, you
%% have to execute the appropriate makefile.  If you are using LatexMk, you can
%% use the `.latexmkrc` to automatically do this for you.
%%
%% The following setup works on Linux, and should work on OS X too.
% \usetikzlibrary{external}
% \tikzexternalize[shell escape=-shell-escape, prefix=images/tikz/]
% \immediate\write18{mkdir -p images/tikz/}
% \tikzset{
%     external/mode=list and make,
%     external/system call={
%         lualatex \tikzexternalcheckshellescape -halt-on-error -interaction=batchmode -jobname="\image" "\texsource" || rm "\image.pdf"},
% }

%% Math Packages
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{amsmath}     % The core math package
\usepackage{amssymb}     % Defines additional math fonts and symbols
\usepackage{mathtools}   % Various extra maths functions
\usepackage{dsfont}      % A double stroke font (for double stroke 1)

%% Define a new command called \withnumber which forces the line to have number
%% (even if it is referenced elsewhere).
\newcommand\withnumber{\refstepcounter{equation}\tag{\theequation}}

%% Allows page breaks in math (1 = avoid if possible, 4 = whenever).  Page
%% breaks can be avoided at particular places by using \\* instead of \\.
\allowdisplaybreaks[2]

\usepackage[cmintegrals,varg]{newtxmath}  % Nice math font with Garamond

%% Tables
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{tabularx}  % Improved tabular environment
\usepackage{longtable} % Multipage tables
\usepackage{array}     % New column types, including >x<
\usepackage{booktabs}  % Provides nicer horizontal lines
\usepackage{multirow}  % Allows cells to span multiple rows
\usepackage{longtable} % Allows for tables to span multiple pages

%% Define the maths version of clr columns.
\newcolumntype{C}{>{\(}c<{\)}}
\newcolumntype{L}{>{\(}l<{\)}}
\newcolumntype{R}{>{\(}r<{\)}}

%% When designing tables, it is better to avoid having too many lines.  In
%% general, the vertical alignments will suffice to guide the eye and the only
%% horizontal lines present should demarcate particular sections within the
%% table (e.g. the title from the body, and the body from the averages at the
%% bottom).  The `booktabs` package provides `\toprule`, `\midrule` and
%% `\bottomrule` for this purpose.

%% Code

\renewcommand{\theFancyVerbLine}{%
  \scriptsize\ttfamily\arabic{FancyVerbLine}%
}

%% Linking and Referencing
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{hyperref}  % Automatically inserts hyperlinks.
\usepackage{cleveref}  % Use `\cref` to reference anything

%% Define some slightly nicer colors
\definecolor{link-color}{RGB}{96 0 0}
\definecolor{cite-color}{RGB}{0 96 0}
\definecolor{file-color}{RGB}{0 0 96}
\definecolor{url-color}{RGB}{0 0 96}

\definecolor{cite-border-color}{RGB}{159 255 159}
\definecolor{file-border-color}{RGB}{159 159 255}
\definecolor{url-border-color}{RGB}{159 159 255}

\hypersetup{
  %% When `colorlinks` is true, all links will be coloured which looks nice in
